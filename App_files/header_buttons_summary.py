The purpose of this dashboard is a visualization of the dynamics of the virus spreading around the world. 
The map can show the distribution of case by country at s selected date, as well as number of active, 
recovered and deceased cases. The plot below the map shows number of case for selected country vs time.  
Also, this plot allows comparing the dynamics of the spread between two selected countries. 
Bar plot shows the top 10 countries with the highest number of cases on the current date.  
A simple model (will be implemented later when more data become available) predicts a probability 
of survival.
