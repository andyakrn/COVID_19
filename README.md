On March 11, 2019, The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized COVID-19 as a [pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic). The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the first outbreak in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, more than 494,000 cases have been reported in over 190 countries and territories.

# Dashboard

The purpose of this project is to create a [dashboard](https://coviddash.herokuapp.com/) that visualizes the virus' spread across the globe. It features an animated map that illustrates the progression of cases over time, along with a plot that allows the user to compare the growth rates of cases between countries. There are also bar plots showing the number of confirmed cases across the globe along with a more narrowed down visualization of the most heavily affected countries.

# In Progress

When more data becomes available, we will implement a simple model that predicts one's probability of survival using demographic features (e.g., age, gender).
